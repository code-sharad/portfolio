# PDF Q&A Chat Application

A modern, real-time PDF question-answering application featuring AI-powered document analysis with streaming responses. Upload PDFs and ask questions to get intelligent answers using advanced semantic search and vector embeddings.

## Overview

This application transforms how you interact with PDF documents. Simply upload a PDF and start asking questions – the AI will search through the document and provide accurate, contextual answers in real-time.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Streaming** – Answers stream in as they're generated for a responsive feel
- **Semantic Search** – Uses vector embeddings for intelligent document retrieval
- **Multi-document Support** – Upload and query multiple PDFs simultaneously
- **Source Citations** – Answers include references to specific document sections
- **Dark Mode** – Beautiful, modern UI with dark/light theme support

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4 with streaming
- **Vector Database**: Pinecone for fast similarity search
- **Embeddings**: OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002
- **Framework**: LangChain for RAG orchestration
- **Streaming**: Vercel AI SDK

## Architecture

```
User Query → Embedding → Pinecone Search → Context Building → GPT-4 → Streaming Response
```

### Key Components

1. **Document Processing** – PDFs are chunked and embedded on upload
2. **Retrieval** – Relevant chunks are fetched using semantic similarity
3. **Generation** – GPT-4 synthesizes answers from retrieved context
4. **Streaming** – Responses are streamed token-by-token to the client

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm (recommended) or npm
- Git

You'll also need accounts and API keys for:

- [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) (for GPT and embeddings)
- [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/) (for vector database)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) (for blob storage)

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd pdf-qa-app
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Using pnpm (recommended)
pnpm install

# Or using npm
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

```bash
# API Protection
API_SECRET=your-secure-api-secret-here

# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here

# Pinecone Configuration
PINECONE_API_KEY=your-pinecone-api-key-here
PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=your-pinecone-index-name
PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=your-pinecone-environment

# Vercel Blob Storage
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=your-vercel-blob-token-here
```

### 4. Set Up Pinecone Index

1. Log in to your [Pinecone console](https://app.pinecone.io/)
2. Create a new index with the following settings:
   - **Dimensions**: 1536 (for OpenAI text-embedding-3-small)
   - **Metric**: cosine
   - **Environment**: Choose your preferred region

### 5. Run the Development Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.


## Usage

### 1. Initial Setup
- When you first visit the app, you'll be prompted to enter your API token
- This token should match the `API_SECRET=hello` environment variable
- The token is stored locally in your browser

### 2. Upload a PDF
- Click the upload button (📎) in the chat input
- Select a PDF file from your device
- Wait for the processing confirmation

### 3. Ask Questions
- Type your question about the uploaded PDF
- Press Enter or click the send button

# Coding Agent

An AI-powered coding assistant that reads your codebase, edits files intelligently, and opens pull requests automatically. Built with GPT-4.1 and runs in a secure Vercel sandbox environment.

## Overview

This project showcases the power of modern AI combined with software engineering best practices. The Coding Agent can understand complex codebases, suggest improvements, and even implement changes autonomously.

## Key Features

- **Intelligent Code Analysis** – Deep understanding of your codebase using advanced language models
- **Automated File Editing** – Makes precise, context-aware edits to your code
- **Pull Request Automation** – Creates and manages PRs directly on GitHub
- **Secure Sandbox Execution** – Runs safely in Vercel's isolated environment
- **Real-time Collaboration** – Watch the AI work in real-time as it processes your requests

## Tech Stack

- **AI Model**: GPT-4.1 with function calling
- **Runtime**: Vercel Serverless Functions
- **Integration**: GitHub API for PR management
- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript

## How It Works

1. Connect your GitHub repository
2. Describe the changes you want to make
3. The agent analyzes your codebase
4. Review and approve the suggested changes
5. PR is automatically created

## Architecture

The system uses a multi-step pipeline:
- **Code Parsing** – AST-based analysis for accurate code understanding
- **Context Building** – Relevant files and dependencies are gathered
- **Change Planning** – AI plans the modifications step by step
- **Execution** – Changes are applied with full version control

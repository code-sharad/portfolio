# Building AI-Powered Applications

The rise of Large Language Models has opened up incredible possibilities for developers. In this post, I share my experience building AI-powered applications and the key lessons I've learned along the way.

## The Architecture

When building AI applications, the architecture matters more than you might think. Here's a high-level overview of what works:

- **Streaming responses** for better user experience
- **Vector databases** for semantic search
- **Tool calling** for structured AI interactions
- **Rate limiting** to control costs

## Key Takeaways

1. Always stream responses — users hate waiting
2. Use embeddings for document search, not keyword matching
3. Build robust error handling around API calls
4. Monitor token usage and costs from day one

## Looking Forward

AI is moving fast, and staying current means constantly experimenting. I'll be sharing more about my projects and learnings in future posts.
